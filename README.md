# Responsive Web Design Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of all the projects I completed as part of the **Responsive Web Design Certification** from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

Each project demonstrates key web development skills using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox, Grid, and responsive layout strategies.
